### 👋 Hi there, I'm Wiwat Suwannasit

**Aspiring DevOps Engineer | Huawei ICT Competition National Winner (Network Track)**

I am a dual-degree engineering student (IoT & Industrial Physics) bridging the gap between hardware reality and cloud scalability. My journey began with IoT sensors, but winning the **National Grand Prize in the Huawei ICT Competition** sparked my deep passion for **Infrastructure, Networking, and Automation**.

Currently, I am focused on building reliable CI/CD pipelines, container orchestration, and observability stacks to solve real-world "Black Box" problems.

- **Achievement:** Thailand Representative for Huawei ICT Competition 2024-2025 (Network Track)
- **I’m currently building:** Automated pipelines and monitoring stacks (Prometheus/Grafana).
- **I’m currently mastering:** Kubernetes concepts and Advanced Linux Administration.
- **My passion:** Making systems run smoother, faster, and more reliably through code.
